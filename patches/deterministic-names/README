With a patched driver and udev rules, it's possible to get deterministic
interface names.


Unplug any Kvaser USB devices.

To unload the current driver, patch, build and install the Kvaser SocketCAN drivers:
$ sudo rmmod kvaser_usb
$ cd socketcan_kvaser_drivers
$ patch -p1 < patches/deterministic-names/socketcan_ean_serial_channel_attr_for_udev.patch 
$ make
$ sudo make install


Now the EAN, serial number and channel number are exposed in sysfs for the device:
$ cat /sys/class/net/can0/kv_ean
$ cat /sys/class/net/can0/kv_serial
$ cat /sys/class/net/can0/kv_channel

We can use this for creating a udev rule, that will rename the interface.
Note: The interface name must be unique and the maximum length is 15 characters.
$ sudo cp patches/deterministic-names/udev/etc/udev/rules.d/10-kvaser_usb-can-ifnames.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/10-kvaser_usb-can-ifnames.rules
Update the udev rule to match your devices.



Usually udev will reload the rules automatically when changed,
you may also execute the following to make sure that the rules are reloaded:
$ sudo udevadm control --reload-rules


If everything is setup correctly, the interface will be renamed, when you connect a new Kvaser USB device.
